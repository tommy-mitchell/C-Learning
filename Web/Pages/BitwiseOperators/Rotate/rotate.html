            <h3>Overview</h3>
        </div>

        <p>This program was based on the following exercise from <i>Programming in C</i>, chapter 11:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <ol start="4">
                <li>
                    Write a function that rotates a value to the left or right. The process of rotation is similar to shifting, 
                    except that when a value is rotated to the left, the bits that are shifted out of the high-order bits are 
                    shifted back into the low-order bits. When a value is rotated to the right, the bits that are shifted out of 
                    the low-order bits of the value are shifted back into the high-order bits. 
                <br><br>
                    The function takes two arguments: the first, the value to be rotated, and the second, the number of bits by 
                    which the object is to be rotated. If this second argument is positive, you rotate the value to the left; 
                    otherwise, you rotate the value to the right. The usage is as follows:
                <br>
                <span class="center"><i>rotate(unsigned intÂ value, int n)</i></span>
                <br>
                    For example, to compute the result of rotating <i>x</i> to the left by <i>n</i> bits, where <i>x</i> is of type 
                    'int' and <i>n</i> ranges from 0 to the number of bits in an 'int' minus 1, you can extract the leftmost <i>n</i> 
                    bits of <i>x</i>, shift <i>x</i> to the left by <i>n</i> bits, and then put the extracted bits back into <i>x</i> 
                    at the right. 
                <br><br>
                    Make certain that the function makes no assumptions about the size of an 'int'.
                </li>
            </ol>
