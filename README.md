# C Learning

A repository to document my learning of C during the summer of 2019, using [this book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16248728-programming-in-c-4th-edition). Some examples were from the book (primarily the bitwise operators), others from the web, and one was a recreation of a game from my high school CS class.
